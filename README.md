# Design Pattern - Builder Pattern

## Description

![builder](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-builder/assets/104809324/0865f3b7-3b1d-4a67-bf11-9980ff4079fb)

The term "Builder" refers to a person who constructs buildings. Therefore, this pattern can be easily understood by imagining the process of building a structure.

For example, when constructing a house, the building process is somewhat standardized.

However, you might want to create a variety of structures, such as a wooden house, a concrete house, or even a candy house.

This pattern is very useful when you want to generate various products from a certain construction process.

[wiki](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_%E3%83%91%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%83%B3)

The `Director` class contains the procedure for building a house. The `ConcreteBuilder` class, which inherits from the `Builder` class, can create different types of houses such as a wooden house, a concrete house, or a candy house. Therefore, the `Director` class can adapt to various kinds of `Builder` classes.
